# Savepoint Protocol

> Version control for thought. A protocol for marking where reasoning forks before context windows close.

## About

Reasoning in progress is the most perishable thing in a knowledge workflow. Context windows close. The thinking-path disappears. Savepoint marks the exact moment a thinking-path forks — before the context closes.

Three documents: conventions.md (boundary list AI cannot alter), symbol-index.md (state ledger), and standardized context prompts. Governance the AI cannot rewrite. Open source, v3.0.

Works on paper, in plaintext, or in a CLI. The tool is incidental; the principle of marking inflection points survives any format.
