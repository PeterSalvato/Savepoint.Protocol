<div class="home-content">

<p>Reasoning in progress is the most perishable thing in a knowledge workflow. Not files, not decisions — the thinking-path that connects them. Context windows close. It disappears.</p>

<p>Savepoint is a protocol for marking the exact moment a thinking-path forks — before the context closes. One self-closing tag. Atomic, parseable, writable by hand.</p>

<p>Open source. v3.0. Works on paper, in plaintext, or in a CLI.</p>
